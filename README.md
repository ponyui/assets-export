## Functionality

- You can export to png, jpg or svg files

- You can export any Figma node, doesn't matter what's inside. So you can compose different elements and export it as a single asset.
- Eslint and prettier supported for **React icon components**
- **PonyUI Assets Export** will remember exported nodes, so you always know if a particular node is already exported in your source code and where to find it.
- Inside the developer workspace you can configure different default folders for different types of assets.
- And you can specify a custom folder for any special asset if you need it.
